            “If you want to make [science and engineering] a civilized environment for women, it has to be a civilized environment for all. Women will and may change from being the obvious minority. It may be somebody else who’s next, who will be discriminated against. It must be a civilized workplace in which all who are competent and qualified can work without fear and without embarrassment. I think there’s a lot that needs to be done but it’s at the side of the powerful, not the powerless. It’s the powerful’s obligation to be civilized.”

            Ursula Franklin was a renowned materials scientist, feminist, educator, pacifist, and social justice advocate. After earning her Ph.D. in experimental physics at the Technical University of Berlin in 1948, she moved to Canada where she lived until her passing on July 22, 2016 at the age of 94. During her life in Canada, she was a senior scientist at the Ontario Research Foundation, a professor in the Department of Metallurgy and Materials Science at the University of Toronto, a member of the Science Council of Canada, and a senior resident and fellow at Massey College. She is best known for proving that the baby teeth of children in Canada contained high levels of the radioactive material, Strontium 90, and consequently successfully campaigning to stop atmospheric nuclear weapons testing.
